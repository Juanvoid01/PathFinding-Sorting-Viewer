### Introduction

A software that generates a simulation of creation and resolution of mazes.
A software that generates an array sort simulation


### What I learnt

* C++ Standard Library
* Data Structures
* Sorting algorithms
* PathFinding algorithms

#### PathFinding

You can place walls and obstacles.
Then you can find the shortest path between the start and end node with different algorithms.
You can generate a random maze using the recursive division algorithm.
You can visualize the process and step forward and backward on the simulation.

The pathFind algorithms:
- Dijkstra
- A*
- BreadthFirst
- DepthFirst
- Bidirectional

#### Sorting

A sequence of numbers are generated randomly.
Then you can sort it with different algorithms and visualize it, going forward and backward on the simulation.

The sorting algorithms:
- BubbleSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- InsertionSort
- SelectionSort
- CocktailSort
  
### How to use it

If you would like to use the software, download the src and data folders.
You would need to download and link the SFML graphic library and gcc compiler.
